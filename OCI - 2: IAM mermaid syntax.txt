A. OCI IAM Core Concepts Map
This map illustrates the relationships between the fundamental building blocks of the IAM service.

B. OCI IAM Policy & Best Practices Mind Map
This mind map breaks down the structure of an IAM policy and highlights the most important setup practices.

mindmap
  root((OCI IAM Best Practices))
    ::icon(fa fa-shield-alt)
    Delegate Administration
      :Avoid root admin for daily tasks
      :Create dedicated admin groups
    Use Compartments
      :Isolate resources logically
      :Organize by Project, Env, Dept.
      :Never use the Root Compartment for resources
    Enforce MFA
      :Add extra security layer
      :Something you know (password)
      :Something you have (phone app)
    Policies
      :Syntax
      ::"Allow group 'name' to 'verb' 'resource' in 'location'"
      :Verbs (Privilege Level)
      ::inspect (least)
      ::read
      ::use
      ::manage (most)
      :Critical Detail
      ::IAM service needs individual policies per resource type (users, groups, etc.)
      ::No "manage iam-family" shortcut!
